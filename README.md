<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved taking over a partially built Power App that aimed to replace a legacy request form. After conducting user testing and gathering stakeholder feedback, I redesigned the app’s layout, logic, and data connections. The final product centralized requests that were previously handled through emails and siloed systems.
<br />

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- Microsoft Power Apps
- SharePoint (data storage)
- Power Automate (email/approval flow integration, PDF creation and attachment)
- User testing and iterative development

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- Windows 11

<h2>Contributions </h2>

- Conducted usability testing sessions to identify pain points
- Redesigned form layout to reduce user friction and improve logic flow
- Integrated Power Automate to route requests and send email notifications
- Connected the app to SharePoint to centralize request data

Delivered training and documentation to support adoption

<h2>✅ Outcome</h2>

- Replaced outdated form system with a streamlined app
- Reduced internal email volume by centralizing requests
- Enabled clearer routing of tasks and responsibilities
